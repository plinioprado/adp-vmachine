# Vending Machine Project

Vending machine, coded in one Javascript class with no interface, that does:

* Print inventory
* Refill inventory
* Re-supply change
* Dispense inventory based on payment
* Return change as coins (eg. $0.35 is 1 quarter and 1 dime)

This project was part of the Application Development Profesional course at Red Academy Vancouver. The required focus was to build an application test it, but in this case there was a concearn in a solid and best practice JS ES6 coding.
