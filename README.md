# Vending Machine Project

Vending machine and its tests, coded in one Javascript class with no interface, that basically:

* Print inventory
* Refill inventory
* Re-supply change
* Dispense inventory based on payment
* Return change as coins (eg. $0.35 is 1 quarter and 1 dime)

This project was part of the Application Development Profesional course at Red Academy Vancouver. The required scope was to build an application using Test Driven Development, but in this case there was a concearn to take advantage of the ES6 resources and best practices.
